\begin{abstract} 
This is the second part of a two part paper on the overlapping finite 
element method applied to porous media multiphase flows. 
In the first part we delt with the formulation. 
I this second part we demonstrate the resuts from 
the  overlapping control volume finite element method (OCV-FEM).  
We  first apply the model to situations with known analytical results 
and show the order of convergence of the various element types, discontinuous 
in velocity and continuous in pressure elements PnDG-Pn+1 as well as fully 
discontinuous elements PnDG-PnDG. 
We then proceed to model a number of test cases to show how the methods 
compare for a range of test cases.

\section{The Buckley-Leverett test case}
\label{res1}
The one-dimensional incompressible Buckley-Leverett equations with gas
injection along a fully saturated ($S_f=1$) bore hole of uniform
porosity ($\phi=0.5$) are modelled using Porosity. The gas is injected
at a velocity of $u_g=1$ and a saturation of $S_g=1$. On the outflow
boundary the pressure level is set to zero. The length of the bore
hole is 4 non-dimensional units. All boundary conditions are applied
weakly. The Corey model defined as: $k_g = S_g^{-2}$ is used to
calculate the relative permeability.

All simulations use the overlapping mixed finite element method and a
number of element pairs (for velocity and pressure) are
evaluated. Saturation is collocated at the pressure nodes. Although
saturation is calculated using a control volume formulation a FEM
interpolation is used to form the high order fluxes and this is also
used here for most of the saturation plots.
Fig.~\ref{bl-exact-meth-upwind} shows the CV saturation of gas (with
horizontal and vertical lines) and the quadratic finite element
interpolation (FEM interpolation). The solution converges with
increased resolution. Note that the right corners of the control
volumes agree best with the analytical solution. This is because
upwinding of the velocities is used (or equivalently the relative
permeabilities) and it is at these points that the equations reach the
balance necessary to match closely the analytic solution.

Despite the one-dimensional nature of the problem, it is reproduced in
two and three dimensions using structured and unstructured meshes to
evaluate the multi-dimensional capabilities of the model. In two- and
three-dimensional simulations, free-slip boundary conditions are
applied on the sides of the domain for the two velocity fields.

\subsection{Convergence analysis}
A convergence analysis is undertaken for one and two dimensions. A
number of meshes and element pairs are assessed with respect to the
gas phase saturation field.

All one-dimensional meshes have equi-sized elements. Two-dimensional
meshes are structured and one-element wide. Their elements are also
equi-sized and have unity aspect ratio. Thus the width of the
two-dimensional domains is inversely proportional to the number of
elements. The time step size is linearly varied between 1.25 10$^{-4}$
and 3.125 10$^{-3}$ for the one-dimensional simulations, while it is
10$^{-4}$ for all two-dimensional simulations.

Saturation profiles for the gas phase at time $t=0.5$ are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:BL_profiles}. One dimension P0DG-P1 profiles for meshes
having between 5 and 100 elements are shown on the top left. One
dimension P1DG-P2 and P2DG-P3 profiles for meshes having between 5 and
500 elements are shown on the top right and bottom left, respectively.
Finally, two dimension P1DG-P2 profiles for meshes having between 5
and 100 elements are shown on the bottom right. The geometry symmetry
line is used to extract data for the two-dimensional simulation.

Results are in good agreement with the analytic solution even for the
coarse meshes and in all four cases the results converge to the
analytical solution with increasing resolution.

Note that for the coarse meshes (5 and 20 elements) high-order
elements perform better and are able to capture the front more
accurately. Consequently, P1DG-P2 performs better than P0DG-P1 and
P2DG-P3 performs better than P1DG-P2. As far as the two-dimensional
simulations are concerned, the coarse mesh simulation performs
slightly worse than its one-dimensional counterpart but for higher
resolutions results are identical.

These conclusions become clearer in Fig.~\ref{fig:BL_converg-rates},
where convergence rates are shown. The L1 error defined as $N^{-1}
\Sigma_{i=1}^N|y_i-E_i| $ is shown on the left, while the L2 error
defined as $N^{-1} (\Sigma_{i=1}^N(y_i-E_i)^2)^{0.5}$ is shown on the
right ($y$ represents modelled gas phase saturations and $E$
represents analytic gas phase saturations). In addition to the
simulations discussed so far, convergence rates for another set
simulations that use full upwinding is also shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:BL_converg-rates}. *** ADD DISCUSSION HERE ***


\subsection{Numerical experiments}
Following the convergence analysis a number of numerical experiments
are performed to evaluate the robustness of the method in fully
unstructured meshes.

Gas phase saturation surface maps for a two- and a three-dimensional
simulation at time $t=0.5$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:}. The mesh and
surface mesh for the two- and three-dimensional simulations,
respectively, are also shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:}. These simulations use
unstructured meshes and the P1DGP2 element pair.

Saturation profiles for the gas phase at time $t=0.5$ are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:BL_profiles}. Results are not spatially averaged and the
geometry symmetry line is used to extract data for all simulations.
The structured coarse mesh uses $1 \times 19$ layers in the lateral
and flow directions, respectively. The structured medium mesh uses $3
\times 40$ layers.


\section{A 4-region modified Buckley-Levrett test case}
\label{res2}
A four-region modified Buckley-Levrett test case is used to
demonstrate the capabilities of the suggested method.  In this test
case gas is injected in a fully saturated ($S_f=1$) two-dimensional
square domain of side length one and uniform porosity
($\phi=0.5$). However, unlike the original Buckley-Levrett test case,
the permeability of the domain is not uniform and four `regions'
exist. A schematic of the geometry along with the four regions and
boundary conditions is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:4reg_BL_schematic}.  The
four regions are square and equi-sized. The permeability in regions R1
and R4 is 4 times bigger than that of regions R2 and R3.



The gas is injected at a
velocity of $u_g=1$ and a saturation of $S_g=1$. On the outflow
boundary the pressure level is set to zero.
Free-slip boundary conditions are
applied on the sides of the domain for the two velocity fields.
All boundary conditions
are applied weakly.
The Corey model defined as:
$k_g = S_g^{-2}$ is used to calculate the relative permeability.



All simulations use the overlapping mixed finite element method and the
P1DG-P2 element pair. The time step sizes are 10$^{-3}$ and 5 10$^{-4}$
for the coarse and fine meshes, respectively.



Four simulations are performed in total with the only difference
between them being the mesh. All meshes are unstructured, however two
of them resolve the boundaries between the four regions and two of
them don't. For each of the two cases (resolving and non-resolving), a
coarse and fine mesh simulation is performed.

Fig.~\ref{fig:4reg_maps} shows the gas phase saturation maps at time
$t=0.1$ along with the meshes used for all four simulations. Coarse
meshes are located on the top, while fine meshes are located on the
bottom. Non-resolving meshes are on the left, while region resolving
meshes are located on the right. All four simulations are in good
agreement and gas phase saturations follow similar patterns. Note
that the differences between the region boundary resolving and
non-resolving meshes are negligible.

Fig.~\ref{fig:4reg_plots} shows four gas phase saturation profiles at
time $t=0.1$ for all four simulations.


Now, we repeat the experiments using the P2DG-P2DG element pair. Figure~\ref{fig:4reg_maps_dg} shows the gas phase saturation maps at time $t=0.1$ along with the meshes used for all four simulationsCoarse
meshes are located on the top, while fine meshes are located on the
bottom. Non-resolving meshes are on the left, while region resolving
meshes are located on the right. Comparing with the experiments using the overlapping mixed finite element method and the
P1DG-P2 element pair, a better agreement between the results yielded from the coarse and fine mesh simulations is obtained. 

\section{An embedded-region modified Buckley-Leverett test case}
\label{res3}

Here a two-region permeability medium is solved.
The low-permeability region with dimensions 0.5 $\times$ 0.5 is 
embedded in a high-permeability region with dimensions  1 $\times$ 1. The permeabilities of the low-permeable region and high-permeable 
region are $10^{-4}$ and 1 respectively. The permeabilities of the porous medium and the unstructured mesh used are depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:square_permeability}. The porosity is uniform and equal to $0.5.$

The initial, boundary conditions and physical properties
used in Section~\ref{res2} are considered for this problem. 

Two different experiments are performed. One using  the overlapping mixed finite element method and the P1DG-P1 element pair,
and another using the P1DG-P1DG element pair. The time steps used are 5 10$^{-3}$
and 10$^{-4}$ respectively.


Figure~\ref{Fig:square_015} and Figure~\ref{Fig:square_05} show the saturation profile at $t = 0.15$ and $t = 0.5$ respectively for the experiments using P1DG-P1 elements, left pictures, and P1DG-P1DG elements, right pictures.
Both simulations yield a similar result. However, the experiments using P1DG-P1 elements show a dispersion of phase 1 into the low-permeability region whereas the saturation profile in the experiments using P1DG-P1DG elements present a defined frontier between the low-permeability region and the high-permeability area.

\section{A wedge-shaped modified Buckley-Leverett test case}
\label{res4}

In this numerical experiment a wedge-shaped high-permeability ($100$) region embedded in a rectangular low-permeability (1) domain is considered, the permeability regions are depicted along with the unstructured mesh in Figure~\ref{fig:wedge_permeability} . The non-dimensional rectangular domain is 1.0 $\times$ 0.1 and the wedge is defined by a high of 0.025 and a slope of $1/30$. The porosity is uniform and equal to 0.5.

Initially the porous media is filled by phase 2. In the simulation, phase 1 is injected from the left boundary with a constant pressure of 1 
and a saturation of $S_g=0.5$. On the outflow
boundary the pressure level is set to zero.
Free-slip boundary conditions are applied on the sides of the domain for the two velocity fields.
All boundary conditions are applied weakly. The Corey model defined as: $k_g = S_g^{-2}$ is used to calculate the relative permeability.

Two different experiments are performed. One using  the overlapping mixed finite element method and the P1DG-P1 element pair,
and another using the P1DG-P1DG element pair. The time steps used are 10$^{-3}$
and 10$^{-5}$ respectively.

Figure~\ref{Fig:wedge_0080} and Figure~\ref{Fig:wedge_0118} shows phase 1 saturation maps at time
$t=0.08$ and $t=0.012$ respectively along with the meshes used for both simulations. In the experiments using P1DG-P1 elements we can see a dispersion of phase 1 in the vicinity of the wedge due to the continuous finite elements used for the saturation. On the other hand, the experiments using P1DG-P1DG elements shows a well-defined frontier of phase 1 within the wedge. It can be observed, that for this experiment the result obtained by both type of elements differ substantially.
