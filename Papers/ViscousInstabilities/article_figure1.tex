The ratio of viscosity between the two fluids is 5. In this case, the initially piston shape front collapses leading to the formation of several fingers.}

(b) Simplified representation of field storage in a \PN[1]{1} element-pair: permeability $\left(K_{i}\right)$ and porosity $\left(\phi_{i}\right)$ are stored in $P_{0}DG$ space ($A$), whereas all other scalar fields (e.g., saturation, density, viscosity, relative permeability etc) are stored in CV space ($B$). \red{(KOSTAS, COULD YOU: (a) REPLACE 1 BY i (top quad of ELEMENT B) AND (b) REMOVE THE WHITE CIRCLES IN ELEMENT A)}.}
